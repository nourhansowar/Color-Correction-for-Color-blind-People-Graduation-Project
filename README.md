# Color-Correction-for-Color-blind-People-Graduation-Project

#                                             My Graduation Project is called Achromatopsia Driver Assistance System
                                             
Our main solution in the color blindness system is to build a color correction sub-system for people with color blindness.

This is done in two steps: the first is to simulate the problem and gather data, second is to build a deep learning model for color correction to be used.

                                             
The solution for correction images for people with colorblindness is a GANs Model. we used a deep learning model because it will be very fast in terms of processing time in the tools, we used like JESTSON board. 
After research in GANs architecture that used in image translation
specially colorblindness correction methods, we found that pix2pix architecture is the best
architecture for our project as also it is used in colorization old images.
