# Color-Correction-for-Color-blind-People-Graduation-Project

#                                             My Graduation Project is called Achromatopsia Driver Assistance System
                                             
The main solution in the color blindness system is to build a color correction sub-system for people with color blindness.

This is done in two steps: the first is to simulate the problem and gather data, second is to build a deep learning model for color correction to be used.
